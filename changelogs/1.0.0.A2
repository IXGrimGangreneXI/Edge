Changes in 1.0.0.A2:
- Added the ConfigProviderService class, instead of working directly with files configs are loaded via this service
- Fixed updater running while its disabled
- Fixed levels not syncing to the client right away
- Fixed A1-style request handlers being broken (stable quests should be fixed)
