Changes in 1.0.0.A3:
- Renamed 'CommonInit' to 'EdgeServerEnvironment'
- Added a way for modules to determine what type of servers they are running in (EdgeServerEnvironment.hasServerType() can be used for this)
- Added a method to retrieve the edge version: `EdgeServerEnvironment.getEdgeVersion()`, it will retrieve the current Edge version of the server
- Added various account and save management events to the event bus
- Added various quest events to the event bus
- Fix certain account data being cached when it shouldn't, this fixes guest migration breaking down
