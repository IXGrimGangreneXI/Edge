Changes in 1.0.0.A4:
- Updated all installers to the 1.0.0.A3 descriptor and software packages (makes it use the banner for fresh installs too)

Fixes in 1.0.0.A4:
- Fixed Sentinel not being restarted by the updater when its trying to restart (REQUIRES REINSTALL FOR THIS TO WORK, THE UPDATER OF SENTINEL IS NOT UPDATED BY SENTINEL ITSSELF)
- Fixed Edge content server accidentally starting while it doesnt need to when using sentinel (this patches players being unable to run multiple servers with Sentinel running)
- Fixed farming requiring you to place a well even if items have water needs set to 0 (why did they remove the well-)
